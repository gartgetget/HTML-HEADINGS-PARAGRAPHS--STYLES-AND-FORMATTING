    <h1>That Should Be Me</h1>
    <h3>Justin Bieber</h3><br>
<p>[Verse 1]</p>
<b>Everybody's laughin' in my mind</b><br>
<i>Rumours spreadin' 'bout this other guy</i><br>
<b>Do you do what you did when you did with me?</b><br>
<i>Does he love you the way I can?</i><br>
<b>Did you forget all the plans that you made with me?</b><br>
<i>'Cause, baby, I didn't</i><br>

<p>[Chorus]</p>
<b>That should be me holdin' your hand</b><br>
<i>That should be me makin' you laugh</i><br>
<b>That should be me, this is so sad</b><br>
<i>That should be me, that should be me</i><br>
<b>That should be me feelin' your kiss</b><br>
<i>That should be me buyin' you gifts</i><br>
<b>This is so wrong, I can't go on</b><br>
<i>'Til you believe that that should be me, that should be me</i><br>

<p>[Verse 2]</p>
<b>You said you needed a little time for my mistakes</b><br>
<i>It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced</i><br>
<b>Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies?</b><br>
<i>What you doin' to me?</i><br>
<b>You're takin' him where we used to go</b><br>
<i>Now, if you're tryna break my heart, it's working 'cause you know that</i><br>


<p>[Chorus]</p>
<b>That should be me holdin' your hand</b><br>
<i>That should be me makin' you laugh</i><br>
<b>That should be me, this is so sad</b><br>
<i>That should be me, that should be me</i><br>
<b>That should be me feelin' your kiss</b><br>
<i>That should be me buyin' you gifts</i><br>
<b>This is so wrong, I can't go on</b><br>
<i>'Til you believe that that should be me</i><br>

<p>[Bridge]</p>
<b>I need to know, should I fight for love or disarm?</b><br>
<i>It's gettin' harder to shield this pain in my heart</i><br>
<b>Oooh</b><br>

<p>[Chorus]</p>
<b>That should be me holdin' your hand</b><br>
<i>That should be me makin' you laugh</i><br>
<b>That should be me, this is so sad</b><br>
<i>That should be me, that should be me</i><br>
<b>That should be me feelin' your kiss</b><br>
<i>That should be me buyin' you gifts</i><br>
<b>This is so wrong, I can't go on</b><br>
<i>'Til you believe that that should be me</i><br>
<b>Holdin' your hand, that should be me</b><br>
<i>The one makin' you laugh oh baby, oh that should be me</i><br>
<b>That should be me givin' you flowers, that should be me talking for hours</b><br>
<i>That should be me, that should be me, that should be me</i><br>


<p>[Outro]</p>
<b>Never shoulda let you go, I never shoulda let you go</b><br>
<i>That should be me</i><br>
<b>I'm never gonna let you go</b><br>
<i>That should be me</i><br>
<b>I never shoulda let you go</b><br>
<i>I'm never gonna let you go</i><br>
<b>That should be me</b><br>
<i>I'm never gonna let you go</i><br>
